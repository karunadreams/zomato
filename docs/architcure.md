# Phase-wise architecture: restaurant recommendation system
This document breaks the build into phases that map to the workflow in problemstatement.md: data ingestion → user input → integration (filter + prompt prep) → LLM recommendation → output display.
## Phase 0 — Scope and foundations
Item
Outcome
### Product slice
Basic web UI — source of user input and primary presentation of results for milestone 1 (see phase0-scope.md); CLI remains for dev/diagnostics.
### Stack
Language/runtime, dependency manager, where secrets live (e.g. .env for API keys, never committed).
### Dataset contract
Confirm Hugging Face dataset fields you will support in v1; document column → internal field mapping.
### Non-goals
Explicitly defer (e.g. user accounts, live Zomato API, maps) to avoid scope creep.

Exit criteria: written assumptions (stack, v1 UI, supported preference fields) and a local way to run the app end-to-end once later phases exist.
Implemented artifacts: package src/milestone1/phase0/ (paths, scope, info/doctor commands, UI prototype mockup), phase0-scope.md, dataset-contract.md, repo README.md, .env.example. CLI: milestone1 info / milestone1 doctor.

## Phase 1 — Data ingestion and canonical model
Layer
Responsibility
### Acquisition
Download or stream ManikaSaini/zomato-restaurant-recommendation; cache locally if useful for iteration.
### Normalization
Clean types (ratings as numbers, cost as enum or numeric band), handle missing values, dedupe rows if needed.
### Canonical schema
Internal Restaurant (or equivalent) with: name, location, cuisines, cost, rating, plus any extra columns you keep for prompts.

Exit criteria: a single module (or package) that loads data and returns a typed in-memory collection or queryable table; unit tests on parsing for a few sample rows.
Implemented: package src/milestone1/phase1/ (Restaurant, load_restaurants / iter_restaurants, normalization, Hub revision pin, schema assertion). CLI: milestone1 ingest-smoke --limit N. Hub integration tests: RUN_HF_INTEGRATION=1 pytest -m integration.

## Phase 2 — User preferences and validation
Component
Responsibility
### Preference model
Structured fields: location, budget band, cuisine(s), minimum rating; optional free-text for “additional preferences.”
### Validation
Reject or coerce invalid input (unknown location, rating out of range); clear error messages for the UI/CLI.

Exit criteria: preferences deserialize from form/API/CLI args into one object used by the filter layer; validation errors are user-visible.
Implemented: package src/milestone1/phase2/ (UserPreferences, preferences_from_mapping, optional allowed_city_names corpus check, allowed_cities_from_restaurants). CLI: milestone1 prefs-parse ... (prints JSON or field errors on stderr).

## Phase 3 — Integration layer (retrieval + prompt assembly)
Component
Responsibility
### Deterministic filter
Apply hard filters first: location, min rating, budget, cuisine overlap—reduce to top N candidates (cap for LLM context, e.g. 15–50).
### Ranking hint (optional)
Pre-sort by rating or composite score so the LLM sees a sensible default order even before reasoning.
### Prompt builder
System + user messages (or single structured prompt) including: user preferences as JSON or bullets; candidate table as markdown/JSON; instructions to only recommend from the list; output format (see Phase 4).
- **Reasoning Context**: Injected free-text "additional preferences" (e.g., "family-friendly", "quick service") to guide LLM reasoning beyond hard filters.

Exit criteria: given preferences + loaded dataset, produce a stable (candidates[], prompt_payload) without calling the LLM yet; tests for filter edge cases (no matches, too many matches).
Implemented: package src/milestone1/phase3_integration/ (filter_and_rank, build_prompt_payload, build_integration_output). CLI: milestone1 prompt-build.

## Phase 4 — Recommendation engine (LLM)
Concern
Approach
### Model I/O
Thin client: temperature, max tokens, timeout; inject API key from environment.
### Grounding
Prompt requires the model to cite restaurant names from the candidate list only; refuse or return empty if nothing fits.
### Structured output
Ask for JSON (e.g. rankings[] with restaurant_id, rank, explanation, and a global_summary) or strict markdown sections—then parse and validate.
- **Optionally summarize**: Include a top-level summary explaining the overall rationale for the selections.
### Persona and Tone
Instruct the LLM to adopt a "Helpful Food Expert" persona, ensuring "human-like" and "personalized" justifications that reference the user's specific query context.
### Resilience
Retry on transient errors; fallback: return deterministic top-k with template explanations if the LLM fails.

Exit criteria: end-to-end call returns ranked items with explanations; parser validates structure; failures degrade gracefully.
Implemented: package src/milestone1/phase4_llm/ (Groq OpenAI-compatible client, JSON rankings parse, deterministic fallback, recommend_with_groq). CLI: milestone1 recommend. Secrets: GROQ_API_KEY (see .env.example).

## Phase 5 — Web API (FastAPI)
Concern
Approach
### Orchestration
Build a FastAPI application that serves as the bridge between the logic (Phases 1-4) and the web frontend. It owns server-side secrets and handles the full recommendation flow.
### API Contract
`POST /api/v1/recommend`: Accepts user preferences (JSON) and returns a validated `RecommendationResponse`. 
### Validation & Health
Reuse Phase 2 models for request validation; add a `/health` endpoint to verify dataset loading and API key configuration.

Exit criteria: a running HTTP server where you can POST preferences and receive the same AI recommendations as the CLI.
Implemented: pending — package src/milestone1/phase5_api/ (app.py, routes.py).

## Phase 6 — Web Frontend (React + Vite)
Concern
Approach
### UI Foundation
Initialize a React project using Vite. Use Vanilla CSS for a premium "Glassmorphism" design.
### Interaction
Build a responsive form to capture: City, Budget, Cuisines, Min Rating, and Additional Context.
### API Integration
Use `httpx` (or native `fetch`) to communicate with the Phase 5 API. Manage loading states and error displays.

Exit criteria: A functional web page where a user can enter preferences and see a loading spinner.
Implemented: pending — folder frontend/ (React components, state management).

## Phase 7 — Experience & Polish
Concern
Approach
### Results Display
Render recommendation cards with: Name, Rating, Budget, Cuisines, and the AI-generated Reasoning.
### Empty States
Implement distinct UI treatments for "No restaurants found" (deterministic filter failure) vs "AI could not find grounded picks".
### UX Polish
Add micro-animations, smooth transitions, and "AI Thinking" indicators to make the app feel premium.

Exit criteria: An end-to-end web demo showing a user journey from input to AI-powered results.
Implemented: pending — UI polish and final refinement.

## Phase 8 — Deployment using Streamlit (optional)
Concern
Approach
### Role
A single-process Python app (Streamlit) that exposes the same recommendation flow as the CLI/API: preferences in widgets → load corpus (Phase 1) → validate (Phase 2) → filter + prompt (Phase 3) → recommend_with_groq (Phase 4) → render ranked cards with explanations (Phase 5 semantics). No Node build and no separate SPA host required for this path.
### Secrets
GROQ_API_KEY (and optional GROQ_MODEL) via Streamlit secrets (st.secrets) on Streamlit Community Cloud or via environment variables when self-hosting—same rules as Phase 6: keys never ship to the browser client bundle; Streamlit runs logic server-side.
### Deployment (free tier)
Streamlit Community Cloud: connect the GitHub repo, set the main file path (e.g. streamlit_app.py or src/milestone1/phase8_streamlit/app.py), add secrets in the dashboard, deploy. Cold starts and resource limits apply on the free tier; keep load_limit / candidate_cap conservative. Alternatives: Docker image (streamlit run …) on Render/Fly/other free allowances.
### Relationship to Phase 6–7
Complementary: Phase 7 remains the primary product UI (browser + REST). Phase 8 is ideal for course demos, stakeholder previews, and fast sharing without operating Vite + CORS + two deployables. You may implement Streamlit without calling the HTTP API by importing milestone1 directly (duplication of orchestration is acceptable if thin); alternatively call POST /api/v1/recommendations if you want one orchestration path.
### UX scope
Forms with st.selectbox / st.text_input / st.slider for location, cuisines, budget, minimum rating, and additional text; st.spinner while the model runs; st.expander for raw JSON or telemetry if useful. Match empty-state copy from Phase 5 where practical.

Exit criteria: README (or a short docs/streamlit-deploy.md) documents how to run locally (streamlit run …) and how to deploy to Community Cloud (repo layout, secrets names, branch); a reviewer can open the hosted URL and complete one successful recommendation or see an intentional empty state.
Implemented: package src/milestone1/phase8_streamlit/ (app.py), repo root streamlit_app.py (Cloud entrypoint), optional dependency [streamlit] in pyproject.toml, and streamlit-deploy.md.

## Phase 8 — Deployment plan: Render (backend) + Vercel (frontend)
This document is the canonical guide for deploying Milestone 1 as two independent services:
Backend — FastAPI app from src/milestone1/phase6_api/ on Render.
Frontend — Vite + React SPA from frontend/ on Vercel.
The browser bundle is purely static and only talks to the Render URL over HTTPS. Provider keys (GROQ_API_KEY, optional HF_TOKEN) live only on Render.

### 0. One-time prep in the repo
The repo already builds cleanly for both targets — Render reads pyproject.toml, Vercel reads frontend/package.json. Two small additions make the deploy reproducible without clicking around dashboards.
#### 0.1 Pin a Python version for Render
Add a runtime.txt at the repo root so Render uses Python 3.11 (matches requires-python in pyproject.toml):
python-3.11.9

#### 0.2 Optional: render.yaml (Infrastructure-as-Code)
Render can read a render.yaml blueprint at the repo root to provision the service automatically:
services:
  - type: web
    name: milestone1-api
    runtime: python
    plan: free
    buildCommand: pip install -e .
    startCommand: uvicorn milestone1.phase6_api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
    healthCheckPath: /health
    autoDeploy: true
    envVars:
      - key: GROQ_API_KEY
        sync: false
      - key: GROQ_MODEL
        sync: false
      - key: HF_TOKEN
        sync: false
      - key: CORS_ORIGINS
        sync: false

sync: false keeps secret values out of the repo; you set them in the Render dashboard.
#### 0.3 Optional: frontend/vercel.json
Vercel auto-detects Vite, but a small config makes SPA fallback explicit and avoids surprises if you add client-side routing later:
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}


### 1. Deploy the backend on Render
#### 1.1 Create the service
Push the repo to GitHub.
Render dashboard → New → Web Service → connect the GitHub repo.
If you committed render.yaml, choose Blueprint and Render fills in the rest. Otherwise use the manual settings below.
#### 1.2 Manual settings (if not using render.yaml)
Field
Value
Environment
Python 3
Region
nearest free region
Branch
main
Root Directory
(blank — repo root)
Build Command
pip install -e .
Start Command
uvicorn milestone1.phase6_api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
Health Check Path
/health
Plan
Free (or paid for no cold starts)

milestone1.phase6_api.app:app exists at module scope in src/milestone1/phase6_api/app.py (app = create_app()), so uvicorn can import it without running the milestone1-api console script. The startup hook prewarms the city list in a background thread, so the first /api/v1/meta and /api/v1/recommendations calls do not pay the full Hugging Face load cost.
#### 1.3 Environment variables on Render
Set in Environment → Environment Variables:
Var
Required?
Purpose
GROQ_API_KEY
yes
Phase 4 LLM calls. Get from https://console.groq.com/keys.
GROQ_MODEL
optional
Override default Groq model id (default: llama-3.3-70b-versatile).
HF_TOKEN
optional
Higher Hugging Face Hub rate limits when streaming the dataset.
CORS_ORIGINS
yes (after Vercel deploy)
Comma-separated list of allowed browser origins. See §3.
PORT
auto
Render injects this; the app reads it via uvicorn ... --port $PORT.

Do not add API_HOST — the start command already binds 0.0.0.0.
#### 1.4 Verify
After the first deploy, hit:
https://<service>.onrender.com/health → {"status":"ok","groq_configured":true}
https://<service>.onrender.com/api/v1/meta?cities_cap=20 → JSON with a cities array
https://<service>.onrender.com/docs → Swagger UI
Note the service URL — it goes into the Vercel build env next.
Cold starts: Render free-tier services sleep after ~15 minutes of inactivity. The first request after sleep can take 30–60 s. The Phase 6 prewarm thread reduces post-startup latency but does not eliminate the dyno boot itself. If demos need snappy first hits, upgrade the plan or hit /health from an uptime pinger (Better Stack / cron-job.org).

### 2. Deploy the frontend on Vercel
#### 2.1 Create the project
Vercel dashboard → Add New → Project → import the same GitHub repo.
Root Directory: frontend/ (critical — without this Vercel tries to build the Python project).
Framework Preset: Vite (auto-detected).
Build / Output should auto-fill from package.json:
Install: npm install
Build: npm run build
Output: dist
#### 2.2 Environment variables on Vercel
Add under Settings → Environment Variables, scoped to Production (and Preview if you want previews to hit the same backend):
Var
Value
VITE_API_BASE_URL
https://<your-render-service>.onrender.com (no trailing slash)

Vite inlines VITE_* vars at build time, so a redeploy is needed to pick up changes (Vercel does this automatically on env-var save).
Never put GROQ_API_KEY in any VITE_* var — frontend/src/lib/api.ts only ever calls ${VITE_API_BASE_URL}/..., and that boundary is what keeps provider keys server-side.
#### 2.3 Verify
After deploy:
https://<project>.vercel.app/ loads the SPA.
DevTools → Network → submit the form → request goes to https://<render>.onrender.com/api/v1/recommendations and returns 200.
If the request is blocked by the browser with a CORS error, you have not yet completed §3.

### 3. Wire CORS on Render to the Vercel origin
src/milestone1/phase6_api/app.py reads CORS_ORIGINS (comma-separated). Set it on Render to the exact origins the browser will use:
CORS_ORIGINS=https://<project>.vercel.app,https://<project>-git-main-<team>.vercel.app

Common gotchas:
No trailing slash, no path. Origin only: https://foo.vercel.app, not https://foo.vercel.app/.
Custom domain? Add it too: CORS_ORIGINS=https://app.example.com,https://<project>.vercel.app.
Preview deploys get unique subdomains. Either disable preview-env builds, point them at a separate staging Render service, or temporarily widen CORS_ORIGINS while testing — never to * for a credentialed app.
After saving the env var, Render restarts the service. Re-test the SPA call from the browser.

### 4. Smoke-test checklist
Run these in order from the deployed Vercel URL:
Page loads, hero + form render, no console errors.
GET /api/v1/meta populates the city dropdown (visible on first paint, served by Render).
Submit form with a valid city → status badge shows source: llm and ranked cards render.
Submit with an obviously empty filter combo (e.g. min rating 5 + a quiet city) → renders the no candidates empty state copy from Phase 5.
Tail Render logs (Logs tab) — request lines appear with 200, telemetry JSON is logged on stderr.
If any step fails, see §5.

### 5. Troubleshooting
Symptom
Likely cause / fix
Browser shows CORS error
CORS_ORIGINS on Render does not include the exact Vercel origin. Update env var, wait for restart.
Failed to fetch from frontend
VITE_API_BASE_URL missing or wrong. Confirm value, then redeploy on Vercel.
groq_configured: false from /health
GROQ_API_KEY not set on Render, or has whitespace. Re-paste, redeploy.
First request hangs ~30 s
Render free-tier cold start. Ping /health first, or upgrade plan.
/api/v1/meta 500s with HF errors
Hugging Face throttle. Set HF_TOKEN on Render, or lower load_limit.
Vercel build fails on tsc --noEmit
Same TS error you would see locally — fix in frontend/, push, Vercel rebuilds.
Render build fails on pip install -e .
Confirm runtime.txt is python-3.11.x; Render's default Python may be too old.


### 6. Rollback
Backend: Render keeps a deploy history; Manual Deploy → Rollback to a previous build.
Frontend: Vercel’s Deployments tab → Promote to Production on a known-good build.
Both platforms support instant rollback without rebuilding.

### 7. Cost shape (free-tier)
Resource
Free tier
Notes
Render web service
750 hrs/month
Sleeps when idle (cold starts).
Vercel hobby
100 GB bandwidth, 6k build min/month
Static SPA is essentially free at this scale.
Groq
Free dev quota
Keep candidate_cap modest in the API request body.
Hugging Face Hub
Anonymous
Add HF_TOKEN if you hit rate limits.

For demos and coursework, the free tiers are sufficient. For a graded review, hit /health once before the demo to wake the Render dyno.




## Phase 9 — Hardening and handoff (optional but recommended)
Automated tests for filters, prompt shape, JSON parsing (fixtures with fake LLM responses), and API contract tests (golden JSON for happy/empty/error paths).
README: install, set GROQ_API_KEY, run API + UI, CLI fallbacks, and limitations (dataset revision, rate limits, candidate cap).
Cost/latency notes: candidate cap, model id, when to raise load limits, caching strategy for repeated queries (optional in-process LRU of recent Hub windows—only if measured need).
